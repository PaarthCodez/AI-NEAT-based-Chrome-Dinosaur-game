#### **A.I. Chrome Dinosaur Game** in **Python** using **Pygame** and **NEAT Algorithm**! ðŸ¦–

No internet? Bored with the Chrome Dinosaur? 
No problem here's a NEAT based AI that will beat the game for you (No it won't run in the web version but we have a similar simulation of the game in python)




## Description

This is the **Chrome Dinosaur Game** using **NEAT** and **Pygame** written in **Python**. 
NEAT stands for neuro evolution of augmenting topologies and is a genetic algorithm that creates artificial neural networks.

In this project, NEAT is used to train an AI to play the Chrome Dinosaur Game.
The Chrome Dinosaur Game is a simple infinite runner where the player has to jump over cacti and avoid birds. 
The game gets progressively harder as the player's score increases. See how far your AI can run!
